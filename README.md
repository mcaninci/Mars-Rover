# Mars Rover Kata


# Description
Develop an app that moves a rover around on a grid.

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is
curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on board cameras can get a
complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.
A rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter
representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The plateau is divided up into a grid to
simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the rover is in the bottom
left corner and facing North.
In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R' and
'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its
current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.
Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1)

# Implementation

This Kata have 2 parts.

# 1.Mars Rover Console App 

In this part, data is taken as a single piece and a Rover model is created by parsing.The resulting model is processed with the services under the Mars Rover Application and the result is reached.Console uygulaması  .net5 ve c#9 kullanılarak geliştirilmiştir.


# 2.Mars Rover App
In this part,  you can create data it by entering data from the UI web part. By simulating you can see the result and visually the final position of the rovers.The web application was created as a Blazor server application, and .net 5 and c # 9 were written.
